    "This blog post is lyrics. About sentiment analysis on lyrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sentiment Analysis** is one of the techniques of NLP (Natural Language Processing). It is part of NLU (Natural Language Understanding). It allows us to classify the sentiment of a text, positive or negative, according to the words it contains.\n",
    "\n",
    "This blog post has three parts. The first part is about **Data Collection**. Web scraping using the **`BeautifulSoup`** and **`urllib2`** libraries. The second part, is **Text Analysis**, we use the **`NLTK`** Python library to compute some statistics of the lyrics of the selected artist. And in the third part, is about **Sentiment Analysis**, we use the **[`VADER`](https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment)** library (yes, Vader as in Star Wars). We will use plot the number of positive and negative songs there is per album. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once we collect the discography of the artist we can plot it in [Wordle](http://www.wordle.net), there is a button to do that, but you have to have Java installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can learn more about NLP with these articles [NLP with NLTK Part 1](https://opendatascience.com/blog/nlp-with-nltk-part-1/) and [the second part](https://opendatascience.com/blog/nlp-with-nltk-part-2/). Also I can recommend you this article if you want to [hack your music preferences](https://opendatascience.com/blog/hacking-my-pandora-data-with-unsupervised-learning/) with song's features. In this blog post we will only use lyrics (text).\n",
